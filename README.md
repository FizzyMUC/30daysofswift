Simple swift projects for beginners like myself

# Hi folks!

I am Pascal, a coding-interest Consultant based in Munich, Germany, and currently learning Swift.

This project was inspired by many other similar projects I found while researching on cool Swift projects on my journey in becoming more familiar with the language. One that is really worth mentioning is [Allen Wongs repository](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift)
I'm currently following a course on Udemy for Swift, besides that I read books and follow a lot of websites or other repos to dive deeper into Swift.

I will try to bring up a new simple project on a regular basis. Daily doesn't work for me due to my job ;)

# Project ideas
During the next weeks I would like to focus on simple implementations of Swift functionality. I'm not gonna do rocket science. So I want to use this space for a collection of what comes to my mind:

## Ideas
1. Import video files from the device and play them, including a nice interface with huge previews for the videos
2. A GPS-based location app (no map!) with the GPS-related data and the ability to share your location
3. An animated Splashscreen
4. Implement 3D Touch Quick Actions, maybe on the GPS-based location app :)
5. A tipping calculator
6. Table views!
7. Passing data to other views
8. Custom table interface
