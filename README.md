Simple swift projects for beginners like myself

#Hi folks!

I am Pascal, a coding-interest Consultant based in Munich, Germany, and currently learning Swift.

This project was inspired by many other similar projects I found while researching on cool Swift projects on my journey in becoming more familiar with the language. 
I'm currently following a course on Udemy for Swift, besides that I read books and follow a lot of websites or other repos to dive deeper into Swift.

I will try to bring up a new simple project on a regular basis. Daily doesn't work for me due to my job ;)
